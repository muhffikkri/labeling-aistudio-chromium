# üöÄ Setup Scripts Documentation

## Overview

The project includes automated setup scripts for easy installation and launching of the AI Studio Auto-Labeling application.

## Available Scripts

### ü™ü Windows: `setup.bat`

Automated setup script for Windows systems.

**Features:**

- ‚úÖ Python version detection and validation
- ‚úÖ Automatic virtual environment creation
- ‚úÖ Dependency installation from requirements.txt
- ‚úÖ Error handling with informative messages
- ‚úÖ Automatic GUI application launch
- ‚úÖ Fallback path detection for GUI location

**Usage:**

```batch
# Method 1: Double-click the file in Windows Explorer
setup.bat

# Method 2: Run from Command Prompt
cd path\to\labeling-aistudio-chromium
setup.bat
```

### üêß Linux/macOS: `setup.sh`

Automated setup script for Unix-like systems.

**Features:**

- ‚úÖ Cross-compatible Python detection (python3/python)
- ‚úÖ Automatic virtual environment creation
- ‚úÖ Dependency installation from requirements.txt
- ‚úÖ Error handling with informative messages
- ‚úÖ Automatic GUI application launch
- ‚úÖ Fallback path detection for GUI location

**Usage:**

```bash
# Make executable (first time only)
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the script
./setup.sh
```

## üîß What the Scripts Do

### Step 1: Python Detection

- Checks if Python 3.8+ is installed
- Displays Python version information
- Provides installation guidance if Python is missing

### Step 2: Virtual Environment Setup

- Creates `venv` directory if it doesn't exist
- Reuses existing virtual environment if found
- Handles creation errors gracefully

### Step 3: Environment Activation

- Activates the Python virtual environment
- Ensures proper isolation of dependencies

### Step 4: Dependency Installation

- Installs packages from `requirements.txt`
- Updates existing packages if needed
- Provides error handling for network issues

### Step 5: Application Launch

- Attempts to launch the GUI application
- Tries multiple possible GUI file locations
- Provides clear error messages if GUI is not found

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Python not found" Error:**

- Install Python 3.8+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Ensure Python is added to your system PATH
- Restart your terminal/command prompt after installation

**"Failed to create virtual environment" Error:**

- Check disk space availability
- Ensure you have write permissions in the directory
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/Mac)

**"Failed to install dependencies" Error:**

- Check your internet connection
- Try running: `pip install --upgrade pip` before running the script
- Some packages may require additional system libraries

**"GUI application not found" Error:**

- Verify the project structure is intact
- Check that `src/gui/gui.py` or `src/gui.py` exists
- Ensure all project files were properly downloaded/cloned

### Manual Recovery

If the automated script fails, you can run the steps manually:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python src/gui/gui.py
# or try:
python src/gui.py
```
